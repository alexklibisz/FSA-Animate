|  CONVERTER USAGE NOTES   |
+==========================+

General Notes:
  The major caveat with the input is that you have to pay painstakingly
  close attention to the dimensionality of your lists when it comes to
  states. NFAs and DFAs are both instances of FSAs, but as you know,
  their state labels are different. I would suggest in the NFA, to limit
  the creation of state labels to the natural numbers. More detailed
  info below:

=============
 DATA FORMAT
-------------

  FSA(states, alphabet, transitions, startState, finalState)

    <states>
      Expects a two-dimensional list where the set of NFA states
      {1, 2, 3, 4} is equivalent to [ [1],[2],[3],[4] ]. The
      DFA states are also represented by a two-dimensional list,
      but the major difference is what's in the sublists. The DFA
      state labels are sets of NFA state labels, flattened to
      a one-dimensional array. For example, the set of DFA states
      { {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2} } = P({1,2}) would be represented as
      [ [], [1], [2], [1,2] ], so that much is fairly intuitive.
      This is the same format as returned by (new FSA()).power_set().

      Alex: Is it necessary to flatten the dfa states? I ask because
      flattening would mean I have to maintain two different formats on
      my end as well.

    <alphabet>
      Expects a list of letters. IMPORTANT: Don't put 'E' in this
      set, or the conversion algorithm will treat it as an input
      symbol. For example, the alphabet {a, b, c} is equivalent to
      ['a','b','c']. It's only been tested for single letters, but
      I'm guessing strings of letters would work just fine. I would
      stick single letters, as they're cleaner anyway, and I would
      definitely not use numbers at all, because that will be a
      nightmare to parse unless we change a few things about the
      transition function. (You'll see what I mean if you examine
      the JSON output of the transition table. Run nfa1.js.)

    <transitions> (is a Map)
      This is a little messy, but it's workable. To define a transition,
      you just add a list-typed key to the map, namely [<state>,<symbol>], 
      letting the associated value be the two-dimensional list of target
      states. Note that <state> in the key is a one-dimensional list
      because it describes one state, while the value is a two-dimensional
      list because it's a set of states. Example: For an NFA, to set

        delta(2,b) = {1,3},

      write:

        delta = new Map();
        delta.put( [[2],'b'], [[1],[3]] );

      For a DFA:

        delta({3,5},b) = {1,3},

      write:
        
        delta = new Map();
        delta.put( [[3,5],'b'], [1,3] );

      This is because the DFA state labels use set notation in the book,
      but they're not actual sets. You know this, but I'm just being verbose.

      Alex: yeah this is a tough one to do in a clean manner. I'm assuming
      we don't need to create a new map for every delta transition, but just
      keep a running one?
      One thing that comes to mind for cleaning this up a bit is to use a comma-separated
      string in a specific format for map keys, instead of an object. We could use
      a combination of .join() and then .split(). Example:

        delta({3,5},b) = {1,3} becomes:
        var delta = new Map(),
          currentState = [3,5],
          symbolRead = 'b',
          key = currentState.sort().join(","); // key = "3,5"
          key += "-" + symbolRead; // key = "3,5-b"
        delta.put(key, [1,3]);

        ...then to "dereference" it if necessary:
        var keyContents = key.split("-"),
          currentState = keyContents[0].split(","),
          symbolRead = keyContents[1];



      Again, this works when you search the map using the list-typed key,
      but the JSON output is messy. Here's an example of the JSON representation
      of the transitions object in the NFA from running nfa1.js:

        {"contents":{",a":[], ",b":[], "1,a":[2], "1,b":[], "2,a":[], "2,b":[1,3] ...


        Alex: this following "flattened" part may be because you're using
        JSON, which serializes an object to print as a string. You can de-serialize
        it back into an object using JSON.parse(/* your json object here */).

        Example (from the node interpretter): 
        var a = { name: "Alex", age: "20", major: "CS"}
        a // (print a)
        Object { name: "Alex", age: "20", major: "CS" }
        var JSONa = JSON.stringify(a);
        JSONa // (print JSONa)
        "{"name":"Alex","age":"20","major":"CS"}"
        var aObj = JSON.parse(JSONa);
        aObj // (print aObj)
        Object { name: "Alex", age: "20", major: "CS" }


      Apparently, the list in the key gets flattened to a string such as
      "1,2,3,a" when the key is defined [[1,2,3],'a']. In this case, the
      label is from a DFA state, namely {1,2,3}. This is the parsing issue
      for when you want to convert the JSON to the visual representation.
      Searching for the first comma from the end of the string gives you
      the index that splits the string into the state label on the left
      and the transition symbol on the right.

      You'll also notice that the first keys are ",a" and ",b". These
      represent the transitions from the ACTUAL DFA state labeled {} for the
      empty set, which as you know is the target state which
      corresponds to the omitted transition arrows in the NFA.

      If this is too clunky or you have an idea on how to clean it up,
      by all means shoot me an email.

      Alex: Yeah we should review this.

    <startState>
      This is comparatively simple. For the NFA case, the label 2 is
      equivalent to <startState> = [2]. For the DFA case, the label
      {2,3} is equivalent to <startState> = [2,3].

    <finalStates>
      This is a set of state labels as in <states>. For the NFA case,
      the set of states {1,2} is equivalent to [ [1],[2] ]. For the
      DFA case, the set of states { {1,3,4}, {1,3,5} } is equivalent to
      [ [1,3,4], [1,3,5] ].

 USEFUL FSA FUNCTIONS
----------------------

  power_set(states, inc_null)
    Computes the power set of an FSA-formatted set of states.
    e.g. (new FSA()).power_set([[1],[2]]) == [ [], [1], [2], [1,2] ].
    If inc_null == false:       "   "     == [ [1], [2], [1,2] ].

  epsilon_closure(states)
    Computes the set of states reachable from the set of input <states>
    on epsilon transitions alone. 

  eclosed_transitions(states, symb)
    Say that you want to know all the states in the NFA that are reachable
    from the states specified in the DFA label {1,2,3}. This function goes
    through each state, 1 then 2 then 3, computing the union of those sets
    of states reachable from each specified NFA state on <symb>. <states>
    takes the form, in this case, [1,2,3]. In other words, it simply takes
    the DFA label for which you want to find the transition, and returns 
    the target DFA state. I can see this being super useful for
    highlighting the set of target states in the NFA when adding a DFA
    transition during the conversion. (Run nfa1.js.)
